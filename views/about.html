                <p>"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the
                    Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth
                    and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a
                    municipal gardener
                    and part-time kit man. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the
                    island of São Vicente, Cape Verde. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and
                    Liliana Cátia
                    "Katia". His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism
                    and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew
                    up in an
                    impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.As a child, Ronaldo played for
                    Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and
                    later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting
                    CP, who
                    signed him
                    for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join
                    Sporting's youth
                    academy. By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with
                    his
                    mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football. While popular with other students at
                    school, he
                    had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him. One
                    year later,
                    he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing
                    football.
                    Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into
                    one, altering
                    his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed
                    training a
                    few days later."

                    "Ronaldo played his first professional match against Inter Milan on 14 August 2002. He came in
                    as a sub during the second half.[23] On 7 October 2002, Ronaldo played a role in his first game
                    in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, against Moreirense. He scored two goals and Sporting won 3–0.
                    Ronaldo came to the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in August 2003, when
                    Sporting defeated United 3–1 in the first game ever played at the Estádio José Alvalade in
                    Lisbon. His performance impressed the United players, who told Ferguson to sign him."

                    "On 12 August 2003, Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting CP for a fee of £12.24
                    million.[24] He was Manchester United's first Portuguese player. He wanted the number 28, the number
                    he wore at Sporting, but was eventually given the number 7. This number had been worn by George
                    Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham before him. He played his first game for the club on 16 August
                    2003 in a 4-0 win against Bolton Wanderers.[25] Many people were impressed with his debut, including
                    legendary United player George Best.[26] Ronaldo's first goal with Manchester United was a free
                    kick. He scored it in a 3-0 win against Portsmouth on 1 November 2003.[27]

                    Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Manchester United in 2007
                    Ronaldo won his first trophy in England, the 2003-04 FA Cup, in May 2004, when Manchester United
                    beat Millwall 3-0. Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match.[28]

                    Ronaldo scored his first UEFA Champions League goals in a 7-1 victory against A.S. Roma in April
                    2007. He scored two goals that day in what was his 30th Champions League match.[29] He played the FA
                    Cup Final that year, but United lost 1-0 to Chelsea.[30] Even though he lost the FA Cup final, he
                    didn't end the season without a title, because he won his first Premier League title.[31]

                    In the 2007-08 season, Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0
                    win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008.[32] In the 2008 Champions League final against
                    Chelsea, he scored a header as the match ended 1-1 after extra time. Although he missed his penalty,
                    Manchester United won the shootout 6-5 and Ronaldo won his first UEFA Champions League.[33] On 15
                    November 2008, Ronaldo scored his 100th goal for United in a 5-0 win against Stoke City. He also
                    scored two free-kicks: the first one was his 100th goal.[34] He scored a total of 42 goals and won
                    the European Golden Boot, an award given to the top scorer of every European national league.

                    He won the first FIFA Puskas Award in 2009. The Puskas Award is given to whoever scores the best
                    goal of that year. The goal was a 40-yard strike into the top-left corner against FC Porto on 15
                    April 2009 in the Champions League quarter finals. That goal was the only goal of the game. It was
                    also an important goal because it sent United to the semi-finals.[35] In the semi-final against
                    Arsenal, Ronaldo scored two goals. One of them was a free kick from 40 yards out. His goals helped
                    Man United qualify to the final, where they lost to Barcelona 2-0."

                    Ronaldo joined Real Madrid on 1 July 2009 for a fee of €94 million. That was a world record transfer
                    fee at the time. He also signed a six-year contract with the club.[36] At his presentation as a Real
                    Madrid player, 80,000 people greeted him at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. This is the world record,
                    breaking the 25-year record of 75,000 people at Diego Maradona's presentation for Napoli.[37] He
                    wore the number 9 in his first season because number 7 was taken by Raúl González. Ronaldo had to
                    wait until Raul left the club in the summer of 2010 to wear number 7.[38] He made his debut (first
                    appearance) on 29 August 2009, in a La Liga game against Deportivo de La Coruña. He scored a goal
                    and Real Madrid won 3-2. On 23 October 2010, Ronaldo scored 4 goals in a match for the first time in
                    his career during a 6-1 win against Racing de Santander.[39] Ronaldo scored a header in extra time
                    in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against rivals Barcelona. His goal was the match winner, so that was
                    Ronaldo's first trophy in Spain.[40] At the end of the 2010-11 season, he became the first player to
                    score 40 goals in La Liga.[41]

                    On 2 November 2011, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-0 Champions League group stage win against
                    Olympique Lyon. The second goal was his 100th goal for Real Madrid. He achieved this in just 105
                    matches.[42][43] He scored his 100th La Liga goal for his club in just 92 appearances in a 5-1 win
                    against Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012.[44]

                    Ronaldo began the 2012-13 season by winning the 2012 Supercopa de España. He scored in both legs, as
                    Real Madrid won against Barca.[45] In October 2012, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions
                    League in a 4-1 win against Ajax.[46] On 6 January 2013, Ronaldo captained his club for the first
                    time.[47] In May 2013, he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid in a 6-2 win against Málaga.[48] He
                    finished as the Champions League top scorer that season. Ronaldo also won his second Ballon d'Or in
                    2013.[49]

                    In the 2013-14 season, Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in one Champions League season by
                    scoring his 17th goal with a penalty in extra time in the final against Atlético Madrid that Real
                    Madrid won 4–1.[50] The previous record was 14 goals, set by Messi in the 2011-12 season.

                    In the 2014-15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal record by scoring 61 goals in all competitions.
                    This achievement helped him win his second Ballon d'Or.[51] He scored five goals in one match for
                    the first time in his career in a 9-1 win vs. Granada on 5 April 2015.[52] He became Real Madrid's
                    all-time top scorer when he scored 5 goals against RCD Espanyol in a 6-0 away win on 12 September
                    2015. This brought his total goal tally to 230 goals in 203 games. The previous record holder was
                    Raul.[53][54]

                    On 18 April 2017, he became the first player to reach 100 goals in the UEFA Champions League, after
                    he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 extra-time win against Bayern Munich.[55] On 18 March 2018, Ronaldo
                    reached his 50th career hat-trick in a 6-3 win against Girona.[56] Ronaldo scored an amazing
                    bicycle-kick in a UEFA Champions League match against Juventus on 3 April 2018. He got a standing
                    ovation, or round of applause, from the Juventus fans after scoring that goal.[57] Real Madrid went
                    on to play the final against Liverpool F.C.. Real Madrid became champions, so that was Ronaldo's 5th
                    Champions League.[58]
